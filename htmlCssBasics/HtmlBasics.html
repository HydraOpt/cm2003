    <!--
    A JPEG (pronounced “jay-peg”) uses a mathematical algorithm to compress the image and will distort the original slightly.
    The lower the compression, the higher the file size, but the clearer the image.
    JPEGs are typically used for images such as photographs.

    A GIF (pronounced “jif”) can have no more than 256 colors, but they maintain the colors of the original image.
    The lower the number of colors you have in the image, the lower the file size will be. GIFs also allow any pixel in the image to be transparent.
    GIFs are typically used for images with solid colors, such as icons or logos.

    A PNG (pronounced “ping”) replicates colors, much like a GIF, but allows 16 million colors as well as alpha transparency (that is, an area could be 50% transparent).
    PNGs are typically used for versatile images in more complex designs BUT they are not fully supported by some older browsers.

    The web is forever getting faster and faster but you obviously want your web pages to download as quickly as possible. Using super-high resolution images isn’t doing your or your user’s bandwidth (or patience) any favors.
    Image compression is a great tool and you need to strike a balance between image quality and image size.
    Most modern image manipulation programs allow you to compress images and the best way to figure out what is best suited for yourself is trial and error. -->

    <h2>Tables + rowspan e colspan</h2>
    <p>Old fashon way to make layout</p>
    <!-- tr is for table row and td is for data cell th is header cell -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1 heading</th>
            <th>Column 2 heading</th>
            <th>Column 3 heading</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
            <td colspan="2">Row 2, cell 2, also spanning Row 2, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Row 3, cell 1, also spanning Row 4, cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 4, cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 4, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- colspan and rowspan attributes have also been used in some of the td tags.
If you look at this code in a browser, you will see that on the second row there are now two cells instead of three, the second cell spanning the second and third column. The colspan attribute, which means “column span” will span the cell over the number of cells that is specified.
This means, in this example, that there is no need for a third td element — two cells are merged into one.
The rowspan attribute is similar to colspan, except, obviously, it will span across rows rather than columns.
Again, the cells that it spans should be removed. In this example, because it spans over the fourth row, there are only two cells in that row. -->

    <h2> Span and Div </h2>
    <!-- They are used to group together a chunk of HTML and hook some information onto that chunk,
most commonly with the attributes class and id to associate the element with a class or id CSS selector
The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph)
whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code

more
div, and especially span, shouldn’t actually be used that often. Whenever there is a sensible alternative that should be used instead.
For example, if you want to emphasize the word “crazy” and the class “paper” is adding italics for visual emphasis, then, for richer, more meaningful content, the code might look like this:
<div id="scissors">
    <p>This is <em class="paper">crazy</em></p>
</div>

-->
    <div id="scissors">
        <p>This is <span class="paper">crazy</span></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Text: Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code + Addresses, definition</h2>
    <!-- Tags to specifically represent text-types, abbreviations, quotations, and computer code -->

    <!-- abbr is used to markup an abbreviation, a shortened form of a word or phrase. The expanded phrase that the abbreviation represents can be defined in the value of the title attribute. This is optional but recommended. -->
    <p>This web site is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

    <!-- blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.
If the source of the quotation can be found on the Web, the cite attribute can be used to point to its origin. -->
    <p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
        <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Blockquotes work very nicely with the HTML5 elements figure and figcaption, enabling a nice, semantic way to group a quotation with a citation:
<figure>
    <blockquote>[Big old quotation about evolution]</blockquote>
    <figcaption>Charles Darwin</figcaption>
</figure> -->

    <!-- Citation Just to make things nice and confusing, as well as a cite attribute, there is also a cite tag. This can be used to define the title of a work, such as a book
<p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>-->

    <!-- Code is used to represent any form of computer code. Further, var can be used for variables (which could be a variable in anything, not just in code -
it could be a variable in an equation, for example), samp for sample output, and kbd (keyboard) for user input.
<p>If you add the line <code>
<var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the <code>destroy_planet</code>
subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> on the planet's surface.</p> -->

    <!-- Preformatted text pre is preformatted text and is unusual in HTML tags that it takes notice of every character in it, including the white space (whereas other elements will ignore a consecutive space or a line-break, for example). It is most commonly used for blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.
<pre><code>
&lt;div id="intro"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
As an example, pre and code are used extensively throughout this site.
The code blocks, such as the one above, are code elements inside pre elements.
In-line references to tags and properties are simply code elements, often inside a elements to link to -->

<!-- Addresses
address should be used specifically for the contact details relating either to the entire web page (and so only used once) or to an article element (see Sectioning). It’s isn’t, as it might at first appear, for marking up any old address willy-nilly.
<h3>Author contact details</h3>
<address>
<ul>
    <li>0123-456-7890</li>
    <li>author_dude@noplaceinteresting.com</li>
    <li>http://www.noplaceinteresting.com/contactme/</li>
</ul>
</address> -->

<!-- Definition terms
dfn is a definition term and is used to highlight the first use of a term. Like abbr, the title attribute can be used to describe the term.
<p>Bob's <dfn title="Dog">canine</dfn> mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father sat him down and carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of chromosomes from different species">allopolyploid</dfn> organism.</p> -->

<!-- Bi-directional text
bdo can be used to reverse the direction of the text, and can be used to display languages that read right to left. The value of the required attribute dir can be ltr (left to right) or rtl (right to left).
<bdo dir="rtl">god lmth</bdo> -->

<!-- Editorial
ins and del are used to display editorial insertions and deletions respectively. Strictly speaking, they aren’t limited to text and can be used over whole swathes of content but, typically, they are used in moderation just like “Track Changes” feature in word processors tend to be.
They can have the attributes datetime to indicate when the edit was made and cite, to point to a description as to why the edit has been made.
<p>I have decided to <del datetime="2013-01-26">decrease</del> <ins cite="http://www.icecreamforall.com/changeofpolicy/">increase</ins> the amount of free ice cream that the State will provide for its citizens.</p>1 -->

    <h2> Meta tags</h2>
    <!-- Meta tags don’t do anything to the content that is presented in the browser window,
but they are used by the likes of search engines to catalogue information about the web page.
There is one meta tag which can be used as many times as you desire inside a head element and they can contain the attributes charset, name, http-equiv, and content.
When the name or http-equiv attribute is used, the content attribute is then used in conjunction with them to apply meta data itself.-->

    <!-- Names
The name attribute can be anything you like. The most commonly used names are author, description, and keywords. author is used to explicitly state one of the HTML page’s authors and description is often used by search engines (such as Google) to display a description of a web page in its search results.
The reason why meta tags used to be so important was because they were relied on by search engines to build a profile of a web page.
The keywords meta data was used (and abused) extensively, for example. Nowadays, however, most search engines use the actual content of the page itself. -->

    <!-- HTTP Equivalents
The http-equiv attribute can be used instead of the name attribute and will make an HTTP header, which is information sent to the server where the web page is held. The attribute should rarely be used (although see charset note, below) but the value can be:
content-type, an encoding declaration, defining what character set is being used,
default-style, the preferred stylesheet from a selection of link or style elements,
or refresh, which defines how often (in seconds) a page automatically refreshes or if it should automatically redirect to another page. Not great for accessibility.
The charset attribute can be used as a shorthand method to define an HTML document’s character set, which is always a good thing to do. <meta charset="utf-8"> is the same as <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">.
<head>
    <title>Air conditioners? YEAH conditioners!</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3"><!--not recommended for sane people--
    <meta name="description" content="This is my really, really, REALLY exciting web page about air conditioners"> -->
